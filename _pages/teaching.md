I taught PHYS 2401 lab in Fall 2018 and PHYS 1404 lab in Spring 2019. I have been listed as a tutor on the [TTU Physics and Astronomy tutors page](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/phas/Academics/Undergratuate_Program/tutors.php) and am willing to help you. You can come talk to me in my office or shoot me an email. My contact information is available below.
