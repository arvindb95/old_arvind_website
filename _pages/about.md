I am a graduate student working with [Dr. Alessandra Corsi](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/phas/People/Faculty/bio_corsi/bio_corsi.php) on studying radio emission from
- merging compact objects like neutron stars and black holes
- supernovae and their remnants

You can read more about my research projects in [Research](/research).

I worked on localising transients using the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager on board AstroSat for my [Masters Thesis](/projects/3_project).

My contact information is at the bottom of this page.
