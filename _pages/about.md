I am a graduate student working with [Dr. Alessandra Corsi](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/phas/People/Faculty/bio_corsi/bio_corsi.php){:target="_blank"} on studying radio emission from transients like
- merging compact objects like neutron stars and black holes
- supernovae and their remnants

The term "transient" in the astrophysical context is used to refer to sources that change in short timescales - from a few seconds to sometimes a few years, as opposed to the longer timescales that characterize e.g. the steady evolution of stars and galaxies. You can read more about my research projects in the [Research tab](/research).

I worked on localising transients using the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager on board AstroSat for my [Masters Thesis](/projects/3_project).

My contact information is at the bottom of this page.
