I am currently a Visiting Fellow at the [Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in/~daa/index.html){:target="_blank"} pursuing research on Fast Radio Bursts in [Dr. Shriharsh Tendulkar](https://web.tifr.res.in/~shriharsh.tendulkar/){:target="_blank"}'s group. 

For my PhD, I worked at [Department of Physics, Texas Tech University](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/phas/){:target="_blank"} with [Dr. Alessandra Corsi](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/phas/People/Faculty/bio_corsi/bio_corsi.php){:target="_blank"} on studying radio emission from transients like merging compact objects like neutron stars and black holes, and supernova remnants.

I worked on localising transients using the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager on board AstroSat for my [Masters Thesis](/projects/3_project).

You can read more about my research projects in the [Research tab](/research). My contact information can be accessed from the icons at the bottom of the page.
