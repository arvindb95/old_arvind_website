The term "transient" in the astrophysical context is used to refer to sources that change in short timescales - from a few seconds to sometimes a few years, as opposed to the longer timescales that characterize e.g. the steady evolution of stars and galaxies. During the course of this thesis, I have worked on radio observations of transients like the merger of neutron stars and core-collapse supernovae. Here is a brief description of my work. 

## EMGW - Electromagnetic follow-up of Gravitational Wave events

Gravitational waves, a new way to probe the universe, were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916. It took nearly a 100 years, for them to be detected for the first time and finally in 2015, a merger of two black holes was detected by the Light Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ([LIGO](https://www.ligo.org/)) detectors in Livingston, Louisiana and Hanford, Washington, USA. The [2017 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2017/summary/) was awarded to Dr. Rainer Weiss, Dr. Barry C. Barish and Dr. Kip S. Thorne for contributions to building the LIGO detectors and for the detection of gravitational waves.

Since this first discovery, three observing runs (O1, O2, O3) have been completed as of 27 March 2020 17:00 UTC, with many compact object mergers being discovered, most of which are binary black hole mergers.

### GW170817 - A binary neutron star merger

Of all the events discussed above, GW170817 stands out as a milestone event, the first binary neutron star merger to be observed with gravitational waves and light by many observatories all around the world. Initial UV-optical-IR quasi-thermal emission has been attributed to r-process nucleosynthesis, a proposed method for the production of some of the elements in the universe like gold, platinum, uranium, helping solve an age old mystery of the formation of these heavy elements. A delayed non-thermal afterglow was observed in the X-rays (radio) at ≈ 9 days (≈ 12 days) from merger.

The figure on the right shows the current accepted model of GW170817 - a successful relativistic jet (yellow) from the merger remnant (central black circle) bored through the slower cocoon material (brown) and interacted with the ambient medium leading to non-thermal emission along with the even slower isotropic ejecta (blue) responsible for the early quasi-thermal emission (UV-optical-IR); this agrees with all the follow-up observations till date. Radio observations from world class radio interferometers like the NRAO facility, the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and modelling played a key role showing that the jet was structured and narrowing down various physical parameters of the ambient medium. On the timescale of a few years, models suggest that the isotropic kilonova ejecta will interact with the surrounding medium and produce non-thermal emission, causing the source to rebrighten. One of the goals of my PhD thesis was to study late time radio emission from GW170817 in search of this expected kilonova afterglow or constrain physical parameters in the case of a non detection. Our deepest VLA 3 GHz observations of the GW170817 field at &#8776;3.5 and &#8776;4.5 years since merger shows no evidence of a rebrightening (still follows the decaying part of the jet+cocoon emission, see plots below), helping to constrain the energy-speed distribution of the kilonova ejecta (see [Balasubramanian et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914L..20B/abstract) and [Balasubramanian et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220514788B/abstract)). We were also able to comment on the equation of state of neutron stars from our upper limits.
