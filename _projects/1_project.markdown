Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are very energetic extragalactic transient astronomical events. The observations of FRBs using many radio telescopes around the world have revealed that some FRBs repeat, while others are apparently one-off. Even for those that repeat, most sources do not emit bursts at predictable intervals. It is still an open question as to what causes such bright emission. To tackle this problem of uncovering the progenitors of FRBs, we need to detect as many sources as possible, localise them to their parent galaxies, and study the local environments of these events. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), a transit radio telescope in Canada, that scans large portions of the sky daily to detect FRBs.

CHIME has detected close to 4000 FRBs which includes about 50 repeating sources. To aid in better localisation of FRBs, the CHIME collaboration is building smaller CHIME-like ``outrigger" telescopes in three locations spread across North America. Two of the outrigger telescopes, one in Allenby, British Columbia (about 100 km from CHIME main site), and another in the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, USA (about 3300 km from CHIME) have already been built and are currently in the commissioning phase. These outrigger telescopes will be crucial in making very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to pinpoint locations of FRBs in the sky. 

- I am contributing to the commissioning and calibration diagnostics of these newly constructed outrigger telescopes. 
- On the follow-up side of things, I am undertaking deep uGMRT observations to study the persistent radio emission from two already localised repeating FRBs to understand their nature. 
- Finally, to explore links between FRBs and other energetic transients, I am working on a broker to listen in on transient and gravitational wave alert circulars and check their coincidence with CHIME FRBs.
