Gravitational waves, a new way to probe the universe, were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 (see [Einstein, A., 1916](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1916SPAW.......688E/abstract)). It took nearly a 100 years, for them to be detected for the first time and finally in 2015 (see [Abbott, B. P., et al., 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvL.116f1102A/abstract)), a merger of two black holes was detected by the Light Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ([LIGO](https://www.ligo.org/)) detectors in Livingston, Louisiana and Hanford, Washington, USA. The [2017 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2017/summary/) was awarded to Dr. Rainer Weiss, Dr. Barry C. Barish and Dr. Kip S. Thorne for contributions to building the LIGO detectors and for the detection of gravitational waves.

Since this first discovery, three observing runs (O1, O2, O3) have been completed as of 27 March 2020 17:00 UTC, with many compact object mergers being discovered, most of which are binary black hole mergers.

Of all these events, GW170817 stands out as a milestone event, the first binary neutron star merger to be observed with gravitational waves ([Abbott  et  al.,2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhRvL.119p1101A/abstract)) and light by many observatories all around the world (e.g., [Coulter et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1556C/abstract), [Troja et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.551...71T/abstract), [Margutti et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...848L..20M/abstract), [Hallinan et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1579H/abstract), ...). Initial UV-optical-IR quasi-thermal emission has been attributed to r-process nucleosynthesis, a proposed method for the production of some of the elements in the universe like gold, platinum , uranium [Kasliwal et al., 2017 and references therein](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1559K/abstract), helping solve an age old mystery of the formation of these heavy elements. A delayed non-thermal afterglow was observed in the X-rays (radio) at ≈ 9 days (≈ 12 days) from merger (e.g., [Troja et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.551...71T/abstract), [Haggard et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...848L..25H/abstract), [Margutti et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...848L..20M/abstract), [Hallinan et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1579H/abstract)). The figure on the right shows the current accepted model of GW170817 - a successful relativistic jet (yellow) from the merger remnant (central black circle) bored through the slower cocoon material (brown) and interacted with the ambient medium leading to non-thermal emission along with the even slower isotropic ejecta (blue) responsible for the early quasi-thermal emission (UV-optical-IR); this agrees with all the follow-up observations till date.
