Gravitational waves, a new way to probe the universe, were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 (see [Einstein, A., 1916](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1916SPAW.......688E/abstract)). It took nearly a 100 years, for them to be detected for the first time and finally in 2015 (see [Abbott, B. P., et al., 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvL.116f1102A/abstract)), a merger of two black holes was detected by the Light Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ([LIGO](https://www.ligo.org/)) detectors in Livingston, Louisiana and Hanford, Washington, USA. The [2017 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2017/summary/) was awarded to Dr. Rainer Weiss, Dr. Barry C. Barish and Dr. Kip S. Thorne for contributions to building the LIGO detectors and for the detection of gravitational waves.

Since this first discovery, three observing runs (O1, O2, O3) have been completed as of 27 March 2020 17:00 UTC, with many compact object mergers being discovered, most of which are binary black hole mergers.
