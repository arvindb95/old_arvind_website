Gravitational waves, a new way to probe the universe, were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 (see [Einstein, A., 1916](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1916SPAW.......688E/abstract)). It took nearly a 100 years, for them to be detected for the first time and finally in 2015 (see [Abbott, B. P., et al., 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvL.116f1102A/abstract)), a merger of two black holes was detected by the Light Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ([LIGO](https://www.ligo.org/)) detectors in Livingston, Louisiana and Hanford, Washington, USA. The [2017 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2017/summary/) was awarded to Dr. Rainer Weiss, Dr. Barry C. Barish and Dr. Kip S. Thorne for contributions to building the LIGO detectors and for the detection of gravitational waves.

Since this first discovery, three observing runs (O1, O2, O3) have been completed as of 27 March 2020 17:00 UTC, with many compact object mergers being discovered, most of which are binary black hole mergers.

## GW170817 - A binary neutron star merger

Of all these events, GW170817 stands out as a milestone event, the first binary neutron star merger to be observed with gravitational waves ([Abbott  et  al.,2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhRvL.119p1101A/abstract)) and light by many observatories all around the world (e.g., [Coulter et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1556C/abstract), [Troja et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.551...71T/abstract), [Margutti et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...848L..20M/abstract), [Hallinan et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1579H/abstract), ...). Initial UV-optical-IR quasi-thermal emission has been attributed to r-process nucleosynthesis, a proposed method for the production of some of the elements in the universe like gold, platinum , uranium [Kasliwal et al., 2017 and references therein](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1559K/abstract), helping solve an age old mystery of the formation of these heavy elements. A delayed non-thermal afterglow was observed in the X-rays (radio) at ≈ 9 days (≈ 12 days) from merger (e.g., [Troja et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.551...71T/abstract), [Haggard et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...848L..25H/abstract), [Margutti et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...848L..20M/abstract), [Hallinan et al., 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...358.1579H/abstract)).

The figure on the right shows the current accepted model of GW170817 - a successful relativistic jet (yellow) from the merger remnant (central black circle) bored through the slower cocoon material (brown) and interacted with the ambient medium leading to non-thermal emission along with the even slower isotropic ejecta (blue) responsible for the early quasi-thermal emission (UV-optical-IR); this agrees with all the follow-up observations till date. Radio observations from world class radio interferometers like the NRAO facility, the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and modelling played a key role showing that the jet was structured and narrowing down various physical parameters of the ambient medium \citep[][]{2018ApJ...861L..10C,2018ApJ...858L..15D,2017ApJ...848L..21A,2018ApJ...856L..18M,2018Natur.554..207M,2018Natur.561..355M,2019ApJ...886L..17H,2018PhRvL.120x1103L,2020arXiv200602382M}. On the timescale of a few years, models suggest that the isotropic kilonova ejecta will interact with the surrounding medium and produce non-thermal emission, causing the source to rebrighten. One of the goals of my PhD thesis is to study late time radio emission from GW170817 in search of this expected kilonova afterglow or constrain physical parameters in the case of a non detection. Our deepest VLA 3 GHz observation of the GW170817 field at &#8776;1200 days since merger still follows the decaying part of the jet+cocoon emission constraining the energy-speed distribution of the kilonova ejecta \citep[see][]{2021ApJ...914L..20B}. We were also able to comment on the discrepancy between our radio observations and the tentative excess observed in the X-rays around the same epoch. We will continue monitoring the source using the VLA throughout the duration of my PhD thesis through our approved observation programs.
